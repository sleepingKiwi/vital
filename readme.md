vital

 - v 0.8.0

![](https://github.com/sleepingKiwi/vital/blob/master/screenshot.png)

---

Used primarily as a starting point for bespoke themes written by [Tedworth & Oscar][]. This code is maintained for internal use and as such may be sparsely documented in parts. 

*vital* is opinionated and idiosyncratic, it collects some of our favourite and most commonly used theme code but is not intended as a theme in it's own right or even necessarily as boilerplate. It is intended to be pulled apart, built upon and stitched back together for each of our projects.

That said, it is maintained under an [MIT][] license and if you find it useful in any way then you can use it however you'd like.

---

*vital* extends and improves upon the work we put into our previous bare bones themes, particularly *vital bones* our previous effort which itself started life as a fork of [Bones][] by Eddie Machado. 

The templates and function files owe a big debt to [Roots][], [_S][], [HTML5 Boilerplate][] and [elsewhere][Stack Overflow]. 

Development of *vital* is made infinitely easier by [Grunt][] and [Bower][].

Styling (with [sass][]) builds upon [inuitcss][] by [@csswizardry][] and relies on [grunt-autoprefixr][].

Image used in screenshot.png: *Surgical-Anatomical Tables by Anton Nuhn, 1846* thanks to [Mary Margret][].

Font credits: as always the fantastic [Goudy Bookletter 1911][].

Credits to external resources and references are usually maintained in the theme's files where the code appears.

---

Rather than take a completely 'bare bones' approach the theme includes many components which we frequently find ourselves using. If you do end up using the theme as a starting point yourself don't forget to strip out any code you don't use before publishing!
